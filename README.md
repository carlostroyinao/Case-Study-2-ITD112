Filipino Emigrants Data Visualization System

🧭 Overview

The Filipino Emigrants Data Visualization System is a web-based platform designed to provide interactive insights into the migration trends of Filipino emigrants worldwide.
Through visual analytics such as bar graphs, span charts, choropleth maps, and histograms, this system transforms raw emigrant data into clear and meaningful information for researchers, policymakers, and the general public.

This project aims to make migration data more accessible and understandable by showing trends in age, sex, civil status, occupation, education level, place of origin, and destination countries over time.
